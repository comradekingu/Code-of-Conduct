GNU\Code-of-Conduct
v.0.0.1

Open Source Code of Conduct that promotes the welfare of a social community.

The receptivity of our community is very limited, their intelligence is small,
but their power of forgetting is enormous. In consequence of these facts, all effective
codes of conduct must be limited to a very few points and must harp on these in slogans
until the last member of our community understands what you want him to understand by your slogan.

On Sexual Discrimination:

Gaiety is the most outstanding feature of our community

On Gender Equality:

The complete emancipation of women from the ties which held them back in the past,
during the ages of despotism and ignorance, is a basic aim of our community. 
Women make up one half of society. Our  society will remain backward and in chains
unless its women are liberated, enlightened and educated.

On Youth Equality:

It is wise to remember that the community that owns the youth, gains the future.
We must ensure that the entire youth of our community will be educated:
  * physically
  * morally 
  * spiritually in the spirit of our social community.

Let the children lead you.

A certain inequality in regard to property still exists outside our community. But,
in our community there is no:

  * lack of opportunity to paricipate
  * exploitation 
  * oppression of nationalities.

We have to put a stop to the idea that it is a part of everybody's civil rights to say whatever they please.

All members of our community are required to:

  * Protect the Code of Conduct
  * Employ your strength for the welfare of the community
  * Be a fighter for truth and justice
  * Conscientiously discharge the duties imposed on you
  * Conduct your affairs with impartially and with justice to everyone
  * Remember all members are equal from birth
  * Remember all members have a right to live, to be happy and to be free.

In outreach to new membership remember:

  * Words build bridges into unexplored regions.
  * Persistence is the first and most important requirement for success.
  * Ideas are more powerful than guns.
  * Prospective members do not know what they want.
  * Prospective members do not know what is the best for them. 
  * Be a person of action. 
  * Silence is the only answer you should give to fools.
  * Where ignorance speaks, intelligence should not give advice.
  * Your goal is not to make prospects better, but to make use of their weaknesses.
  * Do not compare yourself to others. If you do so, you are insulting yourself.

Conflict Resolution:

  * It is better to make a mistake than to do nothing.

Finally:

  * If you dont like a Ruleâ€¦ Just Follow it.. Reach the top.. and Change the Rule
